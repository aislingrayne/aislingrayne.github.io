### Nau mai, haere mai. Here, you will find a brief introduction to myself, collaborators and our work.

<img src="../images/profile.png" class="aligncenter" style="max-width:200px" alt="profile">

I'm currently a Research Assistant (conservation genomics) with A/Prof [Tammy Steeves](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/contact-us/people/tammy-steeves.html) who co-leads [ConSERTeam](http://www.ucconsert.org/) at the School of Biological Sciences (University of Canterbury) in Aotearoa NZ. In the near future, I'll embark on a six-month research position based at the Centre of Sustainability (University of Otago) with A/Prof [Cilla Wehi](http://www.priscillawehi.com/) to conduct a thematic analysis aligned with the *[Kindness in Science](http://www.kindnessinscience.org/)* project at [Te Pūnaha o Matatini](https://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz/). This research project will be advised by Tammy Steeves, [Dr Emma Sharp](https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/el-sharp), [Dr Leilani Walker](https://leilani-walker.com/), and [Prof Shaun Hendy](https://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz/shaun-hendy/).

The work found below reflects the collective knowledge and efforts of many, including whānau, local communities, and practitioners (e.g.,[KEEWAI](http://keewai.co.nz/), [Tūhaitara Coastal Park](https://www.tuhaitarapark.org.nz/), [Te Nohoaka o Tukiauau](https://www.tenohoaka.org.nz/)). For example, our research for kēkēwai, also known as wai kōura, freshwater crayfish, or crawlies, aims to reconnect people and place by exploring relationships of place encoded in oral narrative and DNA. 

Ko wai au? My ancestors journeyed to Aotearoa New Zealand from Ireland, England, Scotland, and Germany. I grew up here on our family farm in Te Waipounamu among the land and waterscapes of Waitaha, Kāti Mamoe, and [Kāi/Ngāi Tahu](https://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/). Research aside, you'll generally find me outdoors—whether hiking, skiing, in the moana, or on the farm—or spending time with friends and family.
