### Kia ora! Welcome, and thank you, for visiting this webpage. Here, you will find a brief introduction to me, my research partners, and our work.

My research interests span multiple disciplines and knowledge systems. At present, I'm a Research Fellow in social and complex systems science based at the University of Otago's [Centre for Sustainability](https://www.otago.ac.nz/centre-sustainability/index.html) with [A/Prof Cilla Wehi](http://www.priscillawehi.com/), as part of the *[Kindness in Science](http://www.kindnessinscience.org/)* project at [Te Pūnaha Matatini](https://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz/). Together with advisors [A/Prof Tammy Steeves](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/contact-us/people/tammy-steeves.html), [Dr Emma Sharp](https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/el-sharp), [Dr Leilani Walker](https://leilani-walker.com/), and [Prof Shaun Hendy](https://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz/shaun-hendy/), and PhD student Bethany Cox, we are applying mixed methods to better understand the trajectory of change in Aotearoa NZ’s research system, as well as the drivers, practices, and policies that enable an inclusive, kind and just system.

My other current roles include Ngā Pī Ka Rere Pou (Early Career lead) and researcher for New Zealand’s Biological Heritage National Science Challenge. I am also Secretary for Te Pūnaha Matatini Whānau (a vibrant ECR community engaged in complex systems science), on the Ministry for Primary Industries Technical Advisory Group on regenerative farming practices, a technical advisor for tribal-led programmes He Pātaka a Tahu and Kā Ara Tīpuna, and I was an executive member of UC’s Student Volunteer Army from 2017 to 2020.

Previously, I was based at the School of Biological Sciences (University of Canterbury), in the [ConSERT](http://www.ucconsert.org/) research group co-led by Tammy Steeves. There, our ongoing research for kēkēwai, also known as wai kōura, freshwater crayfish, or crawlies, aims to reconnect people and place by exploring relationships encoded in oral narrative and DNA. That work, which you can find below, reflects the collective knowledge and efforts of many, including Kāi Tahu whānui, local communities and practitioners (e.g., [KEEWAI](http://keewai.co.nz/), [Tūhaitara Coastal Park](https://www.tuhaitarapark.org.nz/), [Te Nohoaka o Tukiauau](https://www.tenohoaka.org.nz/)).

Ko wai au? I'm Pākehā (a non-Indigenous New Zealander of Irish / English descent). I grew up on a family farm in Te Waipounamu among the land and waterscapes of Waitaha, Kāti Mamoe, and Kāi Tahu. Research aside, you'll generally find me outdoors or with friends and family.
