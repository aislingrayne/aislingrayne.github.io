### _Kia ora! Welcome, and thank you, for visiting this webpage. Here, you can find a brief introduction to my past and current research_.

I'm currently a Research Fellow in social and complex systems science based at the University of Otago's [Centre for Sustainability](https://www.otago.ac.nz/centre-sustainability/index.html) with [A/Prof Cilla Wehi](http://www.priscillawehi.com/), as part of the [_Kindness in Science_](http://www.kindnessinscience.org/) project at [Te Pūnaha Matatini](https://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz/). Together with advisors [A/Prof Tammy Steeves](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/contact-us/people/tammy-steeves.html), [Dr Emma Sharp](https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/el-sharp), [Dr Leilani Walker](https://leilani-walker.com/), and [Prof Shaun Hendy](https://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz/shaun-hendy/), and PhD student Bethany Cox, we are applying mixed methods approaches to better understand the trajectory of change in Aotearoa NZ’s research system, as well as the drivers, practices, and policies that enable an inclusive, kind and just system.

I'm also a researcher and co-lead for Ngā Pī Ka Rere in New Zealand’s Biological Heritage National Science Challenge. My other hats include Secretary for Te Pūnaha Matatini Whānau, the Ministry for Primary Industries Technical Advisory Group on regenerative farming practices, and technical advisor for whānau-led programmes He Pātaka a Tahu and Kā Ara Tīpuna.

Previously, I was based at the School of Biological Sciences (University of Canterbury), in the [ConSERT](http://www.ucconsert.org/) research group co-led by Tammy Steeves. During my PhD, we examined relationships encoded in oral narrative and genomic markers for kēkēwai (wai kōura or freshwater crayfish). That work, which you can find below, represents the collective knowledge and efforts of many, including Kāi Tahu whānui, local communities and practitioners (e.g., [KEEWAI](http://keewai.co.nz/), [Tūhaitara Coastal Park](https://www.tuhaitarapark.org.nz/), [Te Nohoaka o Tukiauau](https://www.tenohoaka.org.nz/)).

Ko wai au? I'm Pākehā (a non-Indigenous New Zealander of Irish / English descent), from a dairy farm in Te Waipounamu. Research aside, you'll generally find me outdoors, with friends or family.

You can access my full CV below. If you'd like to chat, please don't hesitate to reach out.
