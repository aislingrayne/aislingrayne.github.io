<h2>A Bioheritage blog</h2>
<p>In a rapidly changing world, conservation programmes seek to build resilience in threatened species so that they can respond—or adapt—to change. But the best way to enhance this adaptive potential is often debated in the conservation genetics community. In this blog, we discuss how genomics can help us to make informed decisions. <a href="https://bioheritage.nz/how-can-we-best-use-genomics-to-enhance-conservation-translocations/?fbclid=IwAR0ZwHmsGsX0cC0_5YRCsf4w3mHs10GFhWm6dfDVe-o7ZM2IngE1Xf2Mrrw">Read more....</a> </p>
